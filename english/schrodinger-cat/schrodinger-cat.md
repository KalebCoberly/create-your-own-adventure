How will you meet this cat?

[Open the box and hope for the best?](\open-box\open-box.md)

Faced with the dilemma of how to meet a Schroedinger cat humanely, you
leave the box as is and forget about the whole idea.
-> You hope it's a Skinnerian box at least

In a show of solidarity, you join the cat in the box.
-> Whoops! Cat observed!

You decide there's no need to drag a cat into this neurotic morbidity,
so you will be the cat to satisfy your curiosity.
->You stare at the lid and contemplate

Go to press conference with cat and box pre-interment to try to stop this
madness.
-> cat sits with back to mic, box's mic squeals with feedback in
uncomfortable silence

Go to speakeasy where survivors of modern science congregate.
-> time travel to The Obit
